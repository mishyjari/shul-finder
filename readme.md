## Shul Finder

## Vision:
An interactive map application listing synagogues near the user or given any particular parameters (location, movement, etc)

## Progress
Initial stage; building a web scraper to pull data on synagogues from [Maven Search](http://www.mavensearch.com/synagogues/synagogues.asp). They have a fairly thorough library of synagogues internationally, but it is organized in inconsistent tables with minimal metadata. Edge case results are being ironed out.
